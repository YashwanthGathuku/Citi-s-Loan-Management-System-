# Credit Risk Modeling Proposal

## Executive Summary
Executive Summary

Implementing a machine learning-based credit risk modeling system for Citi's loan management platform will significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of credit risk assessments. By automating the evaluation of loan applications using advanced algorithms, we can reduce manual workload, minimize human error, and expedite the loan approval process. This system will provide predictive insights into a borrower's likelihood of default, enabling more informed decision-making and contributing to better risk management and profitability.

## Data Requirements
To develop a robust credit risk modeling system, we require several types of data:

### Borrower Information
- **Personal Details**: Name, age, gender, marital status, number of dependents.
- **Employment Details**: Occupation, employment status, tenure with current employer.
- **Income Information**: Annual salary and any additional income sources.
- **Educational Background**: Highest level of education attained.

### Financial History
- **Credit History**: Credit score, history of past loans, credit card usage, repayment history.
- **Existing Debts**: Number of existing loans, credit cards, and other debts.
- **Repayment Behavior**: Records of on-time payments, delinquencies, defaults.
``Note: Financial history data will be obtained from credit bureaus to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness.``
