## Overview

As part of the Citi Virtual Internship Program, I worked on several Java applications aimed to designed to improve internal tools and workflows. Each task focuses on a different aspect of these processes, with solution to solve real-world financial challenges.

## Internship Role:
As a Technology Analyst Intern at Citi , responsibilities included:

- Collaborating with cross-functional teams to understand business requirements and translate them into technical solutions.
- Developing software applications that enhance operational efficiency and improve decision-making processes.
- Conducting research on machine learning applications in finance, particularly for credit risk assessment.
- Creating diagrams and documentation to support project workflows and system designs.

The tasks included:
- Task 1. Model the loan management process with a UML state diagram.
- Task 2: Propose a machine learning-based credit risk modeling system.
- Task 3: Develop a stock monitoring tool to retrieve live stock data.
- Task 4: Enhance the stock monitoring tool with live data visualization.
